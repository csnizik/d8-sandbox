Notes on creating a local (staging) copy of an existing (production) Drupal site.

1) Create a database with the same name as the one you're copying.
2) In PHPMySql (prod), go to the database you're copying and Export. 
3) In PHPMySql (staging), go to the new database and Import.
4) Copy all files from Prod to Staging.
5) Change the name of the user that will access the database: in /sites/default/settings.php, change the username from the one that's used on Prod to 'root' (as long as 'root' is a user in your Staging db). I picked root because it doesn't have a password; so you can just erase the string given in settings.php for password.
6) Open the new staging site. You may get bombarded with errors at the top of every page. If so, log in as Admin and go to Configuration > Media > File System. Make sure that the "Temporary directory" has the name of a directory in your localhost root directory. The default Temporary directory path in a Drupal install is /tmp. But in a WAMPServer installation, there's a folder in the root directory called "temp". So... just change the path in the Drupal configuration to '/temp'. Don't close File System yet.
7) Remap where Drupal looks for private files. By default, the "Private file system path" is blank. Change it to [Public file system path]/private. Example: if Public path is sites/default/files, then make the private path sites/default/files/private. HOWEVER for the strongest security, the private directory should actually be private, i.e. located outside of the Drupal root folder (in public_html, www, etc.)
8) On the Staging site: Configuration > Performance > Clear All Caches If any images aren't loading (i.e., images that are called by the CSS) then
